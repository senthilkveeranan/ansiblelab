senario: Creating file and setting permissions & copying content
=================================================================
Using ad-hoc commands, create a file '/root/file1.txt' on all managed nodes
File should contain text This text file is created using ansible
Remove all permissions for others on this file 

# ansible all -m file -a "path=/root/file1.txt  mode=o-rwx state=touch " --become
# ansible all -m copy -a "content='This text file is created using Ansible' dest=/root/file1.txt" --become
