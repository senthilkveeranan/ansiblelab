Other then the default fact if we want to fetch any configuration information about the managed
nodes is called custome fact .
Ex: I need to find the git version, http version, weblogic version, db version etc for all 
my managed nodes.
Ex 2: if we want to identify prod/dev/test servers is the requirement 
we need to write a playbook to get the information 


How to create customer facts:
=============================
1) First we need to create /etc/anisble/facts.d directory on managed nodes 
2) inside facts.d directory place one or more custome facts files with extention as .fact 
3) The output of custome fact file should be JSON fomat file  
4) The fact file should have execution permission .
